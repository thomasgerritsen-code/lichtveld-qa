# RT-VTech LINAC simulator roadmap

This scorecard is an educational engineering audit, not an OEM specification. Scores are 1–5 and only change when public evidence, code behaviour or regression coverage changes.

| Subsystem | Geometry / topology | Physics / behavior | Graphics / readability | Cause-effect interaction | Regression coverage | Status |

| Treatment head / beam path | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | In progress |
| Agility MLC / diaphragms | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | In progress |
| Electron gun / RF / waveguide | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | Priority |

## Golden path

Electron gun → RF / travelling-wave acceleration → Focus 1 → 1R/1T → Focus 2 → 2R/2T → slalom bending / flight tube → photon target or electron window → photon filtering or electron scattering → monitor chamber → backscatter plate (photon head) → optical field system → Agility MLC / sculpted diaphragms or electron applicator → diverging field projection → isocentre / patient plane.

## Causality map

- RF level → normalized accelerator response → useful beam response.
- Focus 1 → upstream envelope compression → Focus 2 → downstream envelope compression.
- 1R/1T → primary injection centering; 2R/2T → downstream trajectory / target-angle alignment. Deliberate normalized mis-steering can produce wall interception / beam loss.
- Slalom M1 → initial energy-dispersive deflection → M2 counter-bend → M3 final achromatic redirection toward the treatment head. The displayed station sizes and gaps are normalized educational geometry.
- Photon mode → target → bremsstrahlung → FF/FFF section → monitor → backscatter plate → optical field system → Agility collimation → diverging field projection → patient-plane field/profile feedback.
- Electron mode → exit window → primary + shaped secondary scattering foil → monitor → electron field definition / applicator → diverging field projection → patient plane, with separate normalized electron-scatter and photon-contamination teaching components.
- Field X/Y → MLC/diaphragm or electron-field aperture → projected field opening → visible patient-plane field width/height; steering/transport loss → beam-axis displacement and/or lower useful primary and patient-output proxy.

## Current evidence-backed improvement

The photon treatment-head drawing now includes an explicit **monitor backscatter plate** between the monitor chamber and optical mirror. Peer-reviewed Elekta/Agility and Versa HD Monte Carlo literature repeatedly models this as a distinct head component in the order target → primary collimator → flattening filter → ionization chamber → backscatter plate → mirror → MLC / diaphragms. Independent Elekta backscatter work describes its purpose as reducing radiation scattered from downstream collimation back into the monitor chamber.

The simulator represents only that public topology and qualitative function. Plate position, width, thickness, material appearance and spacing are normalized educational graphics; no manufacturer dimensions, compositions, service tolerances or quantitative backscatter corrections are encoded. The existing monitor/delivery physics is deliberately unchanged rather than inventing a second unsupported correction model.

## Recent evidence-backed improvements

- Electron mode depicts a dual scattering-foil topology: thin primary foil followed by a shaped secondary foil upstream of the monitor chamber, using normalized educational geometry only.
- Slalom graphics align three explicit normalized magnet stations with the same mechanical path used by the beam renderer, reducing geometry/renderer drift.
- Focus / steering graphics distinguish focusing hardware from two-axis steering hardware and make the different 1R/1T versus 2R/2T roles visible without changing beam physics.
- Patient-plane feedback makes FF/FFF shape, electron secondary components, field size, steering displacement and useful-output loss visible in one causal view sourced from the existing physics state.
- Head-to-isocentre projection closes the visible spatial gap between treatment-head field definition and the patient plane without implying OEM distances.
- Golden-path navigation links the full machine chain into one selectable, mode-aware educational sequence on desktop and mobile.
- Photon-head topology now explicitly includes the source-supported monitor backscatter plate between the chamber and field-light mirror.

## Next highest-value gap

Treatment-head topology/graphics/regression coverage now meet the current source-supported 5/5 audit threshold, while physics and interaction remain intentionally 4/5 because no new quantitative backscatter model was justified. Rotate to **electron gun / RF / waveguide** next: audit whether the public travelling-wave input/coupler, cell progression and electron-injection presentation have a concrete source-supported topology or causal gap. If that audit finds no meaningful gap, leave main unchanged rather than polishing completed treatment-head graphics.

## Definition of done

A subsystem can be marked DONE when public sources support its topology, normalized relative geometry is credible and readable, mode-dependent behavior and cause→effect are understandable, and regression tests cover its core behavior. DONE areas are not revisited for cosmetic micro-tweaks without new evidence or integration need.

## Process note

For machine-head audits, compare the simulator against an explicit public-source component-order list, not only against overall visual similarity. A missing but independently documented component is a stronger reason for change than cosmetic refinement. Keep qualitative protective/monitoring functions visible in topology without adding quantitative response models unless public evidence supports a safe normalized causal model.
